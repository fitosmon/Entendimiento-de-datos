It’s a short hop to the city centre (ask for a three-stop hop on any local bus and you’ll be in Cabot Circus in no time). We have free on-street parking right outside our door, so you don’t have to worry about pay and display or the parking permits which now place restrictions on motorists in many other parts of the city. If you don’t have a car, that’s no problem, as there is a regular bus into town that stops on our street, or you can take the train from Stapleton Road station and be at Temple Meads or Clifton in no time. If you like a good walk, you can get to Broadmead in around 40 minutes by following the Bristol and Bath Railway Path into town. However, if you want to feel like a real Bristolian, the preferred way to get about Britain’s first ‘cycling city’ is by bike, of course. Our house is handily located next to the Bristol and Bath Railway Path, so why not bring your bikes? The ride to Bath through the Avon Valley is stunningI am a Bristolian born and raised; my wife and I met here at university. Bristol really is a beautiful city. We love taking walks around the Floating Harbour, ensuring we take time to stop for coffee at the Olive Shed, a swift half at the Nova Scotia Hotel, or maybe even a delicious bite to eat at the containers on Wapping Wharf. We also enjoy taking in the stunning views from the top of Brandon Hill before checking out the quirky, artsy shops on Park Street. We always like to look in at the Boston Tea Party on Park Street, where the ‘secret garden’ provides perfect respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. We’ve owned our house in Easton since July 2019. Recently voted one of the top 50 coolest neighbourhoods in the world by TimeOut Magazine (September 2019), Easton really does have something for everyone. You will find trendy cafés selling excellent coffee and home-made cakes, world-beating curry restaurants, and plenty of friendly local boozers. We like to visit the gorgeous Este Kitchen for coffee and brunch. Just opposite, the Greenbank pub is a great spot for lunch or an evening pint or two; their guest ales change all the time and they have a decent selection of board games. If you’re planning a quiet night in, G Bros Pizza will do you a perfectly baked pizza. The M’Sala Library truly is one of the best curries I’ve ever eaten; be sure to ask for the vegetable samosas which are to die for. For the discerning foodie, the famous Bristol Sweet Mart on St Mark’s Road is a five-minute walk away. There you’ll find ingredients for sale from all four corners of the globe. Worth a trip, even just for a browse. We look forward to hosting you soon in beautiful BS5. Chris, Justine and baby Louis.
