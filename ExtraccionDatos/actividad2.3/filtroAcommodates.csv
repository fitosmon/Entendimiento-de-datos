It’s a short hop to the city centre (ask for a three-stop hop on any local bus and you’ll be in Cabot Circus in no time). We have free on-street parking right outside our door, so you don’t have to worry about pay and display or the parking permits which now place restrictions on motorists in many other parts of the city. If you don’t have a car, that’s no problem, as there is a regular bus into town that stops on our street, or you can take the train from Stapleton Road station and be at Temple Meads or Clifton in no time. If you like a good walk, you can get to Broadmead in around 40 minutes by following the Bristol and Bath Railway Path into town. However, if you want to feel like a real Bristolian, the preferred way to get about Britain’s first ‘cycling city’ is by bike, of course. Our house is handily located next to the Bristol and Bath Railway Path, so why not bring your bikes? The ride to Bath through the Avon Valley is stunningI am a Bristolian born and raised; my wife and I met here at university. Bristol really is a beautiful city. We love taking walks around the Floating Harbour, ensuring we take time to stop for coffee at the Olive Shed, a swift half at the Nova Scotia Hotel, or maybe even a delicious bite to eat at the containers on Wapping Wharf. We also enjoy taking in the stunning views from the top of Brandon Hill before checking out the quirky, artsy shops on Park Street. We always like to look in at the Boston Tea Party on Park Street, where the ‘secret garden’ provides perfect respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. We’ve owned our house in Easton since July 2019. Recently voted one of the top 50 coolest neighbourhoods in the world by TimeOut Magazine (September 2019), Easton really does have something for everyone. You will find trendy cafés selling excellent coffee and home-made cakes, world-beating curry restaurants, and plenty of friendly local boozers. We like to visit the gorgeous Este Kitchen for coffee and brunch. Just opposite, the Greenbank pub is a great spot for lunch or an evening pint or two; their guest ales change all the time and they have a decent selection of board games. If you’re planning a quiet night in, G Bros Pizza will do you a perfectly baked pizza. The M’Sala Library truly is one of the best curries I’ve ever eaten; be sure to ask for the vegetable samosas which are to die for. For the discerning foodie, the famous Bristol Sweet Mart on St Mark’s Road is a five-minute walk away. There you’ll find ingredients for sale from all four corners of the globe. Worth a trip, even just for a browse. We look forward to hosting you soon in beautiful BS5. Chris, Justine and baby Louis.

The waterside vibe, the profusion of great places to eat and drink, the lack of roads to the rear and the location (very central) makes it unique.<br /><br /><br />Our recommendations for arts and culture:<br /><br />- Arnolfini. A landmark arts centre and a beautiful spot on the harbour.<br /><br />- Watershed. Just on the opposite quay, great for film. <br /><br />- Bristol Museum. Usually has a good exhibition on but also has a great collection, particularly Victorian painters.<br /><br />- Bristol Old Vic. Worth a visit as such a historic theatre and now looks fabulous after major refurb. <br /><br />- Tobacco Factory. Very cool place, some good productions. Also on North Street, home to Upfest and some of the best graffiti in the country.<br /><br />- M Shed. Tells the story of Bristol wonderfully. <br /><br />- Banksy. Stuff everywhere, some iconic.

It is a wonderful area to visit in Bristol, and it has its own distinct feel with its beautiful terraced houses, many of which are painted in pastel colours.<br />There is loads to see and do in Montpelier. One of the first things you’ll notice is the street art. The Silent Hobo mural at Montpelier Station is one of the most well-known murals in Bristol.<br />Much of the best things about Montpelier can be found on the busy, bustling Picton Street.

Our cozy, colourful and well loved home is set in a quiet, leafy road in North East Bristol.  We are 20 minutes by bus from the city centre and close to extensive parkland with foot and cycle paths.","Our road overlooks the Frome Valley, which is North Bristol’s ‘green lung”.  Beyond our garden about six acres of council allotments separate us from the River Frome, and a small lane about 200 metres from our front door leads down to the Frome valley walkway.  This gives us access to several miles of paths that link Eastville Park (with its children’s playground), Snuff Mills river and woods, Oldbury Court Estate, Stoke Park Estate and Purdown.  We regularly do a 2 hours circular walk from the house to Purdown and back that involves only a few hundred yards on roads, the rest being footpaths along the river through woods and fields and over hills.<br /><br />There is plenty of wildlife to be seen in season.  There are resident buzzards and sparrowhawks in the valley along with jays, jackdaws, crows, magpies and the inevitable seagulls.   In summer we await the arrival of swifts and occasionally see a peregrine falcon flying over from the Avon Gorge on the other side of Bristol.

Then a few of years ago we took the whole family to Southern India for a month which was amazing (I spent a year there in the 80's and hadn't been back since).
